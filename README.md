# SimulateWashingTheAir
This notebook was made to simulate "Washing The Air" technique.

The approach is based on water condensing on aerosols in the air, increasing its mass which eventually drops to the bottom of chamber due to gravity. A report is contained in this repository for details on the mechanism.

This is a group project done as part of a course from BSc Physics at University College London supervised by Prof Ian Ford.

Special thanks to my simulation groupmates, Socratis Michail and Pelumi Adeleke-Ademola.
